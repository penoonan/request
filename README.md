HttpFoundation Request Component
========================

In Wordpress development I kept finding myself wanting to use Symfony's Reqeust object without any of the rest of HttpFoundation.

This library includes only the HttpFoundation classes required for abstracting a Request.
 
Note: if you want to use sessions, load "[pno/session](https://github.com/penoonan/session)".
